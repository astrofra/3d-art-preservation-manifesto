# Manifesto for the preservation of real-time 3D digital artworks

*Version 1.0 - Date: 2024-11-03*

This manifesto outlines preservation principles for digital artists using real-time 3D, in order to enable the restoration of works in the future, in the event of technological obsolescence. We do not dictate how a work should be restored or adapted; we offer recommendations to ensure that the essential elements of the work are available to potential restorers, while respecting the vision and freedom of the artist.

## 1. The Freedom of the Artist

The artist retains complete freedom in the choice of storage formats, deciding which elements to share, selecting the appropriate license, and choosing the storage method. This manifesto simply suggests principles, and we respect each artistâ€™s right to decide on the preservation methods for their work.

## 2. Choosing the Format

To ensure a certain durability of the essential elements of the artwork, we recommend the following formats:
   
   - **Source Code**: Source code should be archived in plain text, regardless of the programming language.
   - **3D Graphic Elements (models)**: Use the most standards formats such as GLTF, OBJ or FBX to ensure broad compatibility and ease of future readability.
   - **Textures**: Texture formats can be freely chosen from standard options (PNG, JPG, TGA, etc.).
   - **Video**: Video files can be archived in widely supported formats such as MP4 (H.264 or H.265), MKV, or MOV.
   - **Point Clouds**: If the artwork includes point clouds, they can be archived in text format (e.g., .PLY or .XYZ) to ensure readability.
   - **Audio**: Audio files can be archived in commonly used formats such as OGG, WAV, or MP3.

## 3. Licensing

We encourage artists to use licenses that protect their work and recognize their authorship while facilitating reconstruction for preservation projects.

   - **If the interactive artwork includes code**: We suggest the use of licenses such as GPLv3 or MIT.
   - **For audiovisual elements (3D models, textures, etc.)**: We recommend the use of Creative Commons licenses **BY-NC** or **BY-NC-SA**, which protect attribution and prohibit commercialization. The **BY-NC-SA** (Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike) license allows derivative works as long as they are shared under the same license. This manifesto encourages the protection of the artist's rights while offering some freedom for reinterpretation for future restorations.

## 4. Hosting

To maximize accessibility and file security in the long term, we suggest using the most stable and recognized hosting platforms, such as GitHub or Archive.org.
We encourage artists to choose redundant and complementary solutions to maximize the chances of data survival.
We also call for institutional involvement from governments for the preservation of digital artworks.

---

This manifesto establishes a preservation framework, allowing artists to choose the terms for making their work available so that, in a perspective of ten or twenty years, if the original artwork becomes unusable, its main aspects can be reconstituted, ensuring future access to digital creation.
